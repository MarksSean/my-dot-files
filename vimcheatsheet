This is my vim cheat sheet.
I Load this by Pressing <leader>cs in normal mode in vim.
I automatically scroll down to the line "cheat sheet starts here" with no spaces between the words.
So the lines before that are a good place for general comments.
I open the cheatsheet window 60chars width, so you should keep your cheat sheet lines shorter than that.
Your cheet sheet should always contain about 7 cheats. (Clean them up and add new ones from time to time!)
Lookup my ~/.vimrc to see how i open it.
